# SnagSnapper - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
SnagSnapper is an offline-first mobile application designed for construction site management, enabling contractors and site managers to document, track, and manage construction defects (snags) in areas with poor or no internet connectivity.

**Marketing Tagline**: "Professional Site Management That Works Everywhere‚Ñ¢"

### 1.2 Core Philosophy
**"SnagSnapper is an OFFLINE app that happens to sync with cloud, NOT a cloud app with offline support."**

- Local database is the single source of truth
- Firebase serves as backup/sync destination
- App works 100% without internet forever
- Sync is optional and user-controlled
- When switching devices, entire data can be restored from cloud backup

### 1.3 Key Features
- User profile management with company branding
- Site creation and management
- Snag documentation with photos and details
- Colleague/sub-contractor management
- Snag assignment and tracking
- Two-way sync between site managers and assignees
- PDF report generation
- Site sharing with colleagues
- Offline-first architecture with background sync

**Marketing Highlights**:
- üöÄ "Lightning-fast offline performance"
- üîí "Bank-grade security with encrypted storage"
- üì± "Works without internet - perfect for remote sites"
- ü§ù "Seamless team collaboration"
- üìä "Professional PDF reports with your branding"
- ‚ö° "Instant photo capture and annotation"
- üîÑ "Automatic background sync when connected"

### 1.4 Target Platforms
- iOS (14.0+)
- Android (API 25+)

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Local Database**: Drift (SQLite)
- **Cloud Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Auth)
- **State Management**: Provider Pattern
- **Image Storage**: Local filesystem + Firebase Storage

### 3.2 Data Flow Architecture
```
User ‚Üí UI ‚Üí Local Database ‚Üí Sync Service ‚Üí Firebase
         ‚Üë                                      ‚Üì
         ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üê
```

### 3.3 Sync Strategy
Sync flags are set ONLY when changes are saved to local database.
Background sync is then triggered by:
1. Manual sync button (user control when flags are set)
2. On object load from database (checks and syncs if flags are true)
3. After object save to database (attempts sync after flag is set)

---

## 4. Profile Module Requirements

### 4.1 Overview
The Profile module manages user information, company branding, and preferences. It establishes the offline-first pattern that will be used throughout the app.

### 4.2 Data Model

#### 4.2.1 AppUser Class
```dart
class AppUser {
  // Core Fields
  String id;                  // Firebase UID (primary key for both local and cloud)
  String name;
  String email;
  String phone;
  String jobTitle;
  String companyName;
  String postcodeOrArea;
  String dateFormat;          // 'dd-MM-yyyy' or 'MM-dd-yyyy'
  
  // Image Paths (RELATIVE paths only for cross-platform compatibility)
  String? imageLocalPath;     // Relative path: SnagSnapper/{userId}/Profile/profile.jpg
  String? imageFirebasePath;  // Firebase Storage path: users/{userId}/profile.jpg
  String? signatureLocalPath; // Relative path: SnagSnapper/{userId}/Profile/signature.jpg
  String? signatureFirebasePath; // Firebase Storage path: users/{userId}/signature.jpg
  
  // Deletion flags for offline sync
  bool imageMarkedForDeletion;     // Track pending image deletion
  bool signatureMarkedForDeletion; // Track pending signature deletion
  
  // Sync Management

### 4.3 User Flows

#### 4.3.1 First App Launch / Initial Setup
```
1. User installs app (fresh installation)
2. Login screen appears
3. User logs in with email/Google
4. Generate unique device_id for this device
5. Check local database for profile (will be empty on first install)
6. Attempt to load from Firebase:
   
   a. IF Firebase has profile WITH device_id:
      - Check Realtime Database for existing device session
      - Compare Firebase device_id with current device_id
      - IF SAME device (reinstall scenario):
        - Download profile data
        - Download images to local storage
        - Save all to local database
        - Update Realtime Database session (refresh last_active)
        - Continue to main app
      - IF DIFFERENT device:
        - This is a device switch scenario
        - Follow Device Switching Flow (4.3.2)
   
   b. IF Firebase has profile WITHOUT device_id (legacy/first login):
      - Download profile data
      - Download images to local storage
      - Save to local database with new device_id
      - Update Firebase with device_id
      - Register device in Realtime Database:
        device_sessions/{userId}/current_device: {
          device_id: "new_device_id",
          device_name: "[Device Model]",
          last_active: timestamp,
          force_logout: false
        }
      - Mark as synced
      - Continue to main app
   
   c. IF no Firebase profile (new user):
      - Create new profile
      - Set device_id for this device
      - Save to local database
      - Register device in Realtime Database:
        device_sessions/{userId}/current_device: {
          device_id: "new_device_id",
          device_name: "[Device Model]",
          last_active: timestamp,
          force_logout: false
        }
      - Mark needsProfileSync = true
      - Navigate to profile setup screen
      - Background sync when online

7. Set up device session listener:
   - Listen to Firebase Realtime Database for force_logout
   - Monitor device_sessions/{userId}/force_logout
   - If triggered, execute data deletion flow
   - Update last_active timestamp periodically (e.g., on app resume)
```

#### 4.3.2 Device Switching Flow
```
NEW DEVICE FLOW:
1. User logs in on new device
2. Check local database (empty on new device)
3. Fetch profile from Firebase
4. IF Firebase has different device_id:
   a. Show WARNING dialog:
      "‚ö†Ô∏è Active Session Detected
      
      You are already logged in on another device.
      Device: [Previous Device Name/ID]
      Last active: [Timestamp]
      
      Continuing will:
      ‚Ä¢ Log out the other device
      ‚Ä¢ DELETE all local data on that device
      ‚Ä¢ Any pending updates from that device will be lost
      ‚Ä¢ Transfer your account to this device
      
      This action cannot be undone."
      
      [Continue on This Device] [Cancel]
   
   b. IF Cancel:
      - Return to login screen
      - No changes made
   
   c. IF Continue:
      - Set 'force_logout' flag in Realtime Database for old device
      - Update device_id to new device in Firebase Firestore profile
      - Update Realtime Database with new device session:
        device_sessions/{userId}/current_device: {
          device_id: "new_device_id",
          device_name: "[New Device Model]",
          last_active: timestamp,
          force_logout: false
        }
      - Download all data from Firebase to new device
      - Save to local database
      - Clear all sync flags (data is now synced)

PREVIOUS DEVICE BEHAVIOR:

Two-Path Detection Approach:

PATH 1 - Real-time Detection (Device is Online):
1. Device has active listener on Realtime Database
2. Listener triggers immediately when force_logout = true
3. Execute data deletion flow

PATH 2 - Session Validation (Device was Offline):
1. On EVERY app launch/resume when online:
2. MANDATORY: Read Firestore profile to check currentDeviceId
3. Compare profile's device_id with local device_id
4. IF different device_id (device was replaced while offline):
   a. Show notification: "Your account is now active on another device"
   b. Clear ALL LOCAL data only:
      - Delete local database
      - Delete all locally cached images
      - Clear SharedPreferences
      - Clear any temporary files
      NOTE: Firebase Storage data remains intact as cloud backup
   c. Firebase Auth sign out
   d. Navigate to login screen
5. IF same device_id:
   a. Set up Realtime Database listener for future detection
   b. Continue normal operation

CRITICAL: Profile read is MANDATORY on every online session because:
- Device could have been replaced while offline
- Listener misses events during offline periods
- App kills terminate listeners
- Ensures 100% detection even after weeks offline

IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM:
- Use Firebase Realtime Database for instant logout notification
- Store device_sessions/{userId}/current_device:
  {
    device_id: "device_unique_id",
    device_name: "iPhone 13 Pro",
    last_active: timestamp,
    force_logout: false
  }
- Previous device listens to this node for changes
- When force_logout = true, triggers data deletion
```

#### 4.3.3 Profile Editing Flow
```
1. User opens Profile screen
2. Load data from LOCAL database (instant)
3. Display immediately
4. Check sync status, show indicator
5. User edits field (e.g., name)
6. On save:
   a. Update local database immediately
   b. Set needs_profile_sync = true
   c. Update UI (instant feedback)
   d. IF online: Queue background sync
   e. IF offline: Keep flag, sync later
7. User continues working
```

#### 4.3.4 Profile Image Upload Flow (Updated 2025-01-15)

##### User Interaction Flow
```
When Logo Exists:
1. User taps existing logo ‚Üí Shows "Remove Logo" button only
2. User confirms removal ‚Üí Logo deleted locally ‚Üí Shows placeholder
3. Database updated (imageLocalPath = null, imageMarkedForDeletion = true, needsImageSync = true)
4. Sync to Firebase queued (delete remote image)

When No Logo (Placeholder):
1. User taps placeholder ‚Üí Shows bottom sheet:
   - Take Photo (camera)
   - Choose from Gallery
2. User selects source ‚Üí Image picker opens
3. Image selected ‚Üí Processing begins
```

##### Image Processing Pipeline
```
1. Accept Input (Any Format):
   - JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP, GIF accepted
   - Max input size: Device/picker limited

2. Auto-Crop to Square:
   - Automatically crop to center square
   - No manual crop interface
   - No preview screen

3. Resize to Fixed Dimensions:
   - Target: 1024x1024 pixels exactly
   - Maintain aspect ratio within square

4. Progressive Compression:
   - Convert to JPEG format
   - Start at 90% quality
   - IF size > 600KB:
     - Reduce quality by 10% steps
     - Minimum quality: 30%
   - IF still > 1MB at 30%:
     - Reject with error message

5. Show Progress:
   - "Resizing..." ‚Üí "Compressing..." ‚Üí "Saving..."
   - Step indicators, not percentage

6. Save to Local Storage:
   - Directory: /AppDocuments/SnagSnapper/{userId}/Profile/
   - Filename: profile.jpg (fixed name for auto-overwrite)
   - Previous file automatically overwritten
   - Store RELATIVE path in database

7. Update Database:
   - imageLocalPath = "SnagSnapper/{userId}/Profile/profile.jpg"
   - needsImageSync = true
   - imageMarkedForDeletion = preserve if true, false otherwise
   - Clear previous imageFirebasePath if exists

8. Display Immediately:
   - Load from local file path
   - Never use Firebase URL for display
```

##### Sync Behavior
```
1. Background Sync:
   - Triggered on network reconnect
   - Triggered on app foreground
   - Maximum 2 immediate retries per attempt
   - Keep needsImageSync flag on failure
   - Retry forever until successful

2. Upload Process:
   - Upload to Firebase Storage: users/{userId}/profile.jpg
   - Store path (not URL): "users/{userId}/profile.jpg"
   - Update imageFirebasePath in database
   - Set needsProfileSync = true for Firestore update
   - Clear needsImageSync flag after successful upload
   - Clear imageMarkedForDeletion flag

3. Concurrent Changes:
   - IF user deletes/changes during upload:
     - Cancel in-progress upload
     - Process new action
```

##### Error Handling
```
1. Storage Full:
   - Clear app temp files first
   - IF still no space: Show "Not enough storage" error

2. Permission Denied:
   - Grey out camera option with message
   - Gallery remains active
   - Tap greyed camera ‚Üí Show detailed help with settings link

3. Invalid Image:
   - Show "Invalid image format" error
   - Allow retry

4. Compression Failed (>1MB):
   - Show "Image too complex. Please choose a simpler image"
   - No save, allow retry
```

##### User Feedback
```
Size < 600KB (Optimal):
- Silent save, no size message
- Show generic success

Size 600KB-1MB (Acceptable):
- Silent save, no warning
- Show generic success

Size > 1MB (Rejected):
- "‚ùå Image too complex. Please choose a simpler image"
- Block save
```

##### Critical Implementation Rules
- NO preview screen after selection
- NO manual cropping interface
- NO original image storage
- NO recovery for deleted images
- NO size warnings if acceptable
- ALWAYS store relative paths
- ALWAYS display from local storage
- NEVER use Firebase URLs for display
- Logo is OPTIONAL field

#### 4.3.5 Signature Capture Flow (Added 2025-01-15)

##### User Interaction Flow
```
When No Signature:
1. User sees "Add Signature" placeholder
2. User taps placeholder ‚Üí Full screen capture opens
3. Canvas shows (portrait locked, white background)
4. User draws with finger/stylus (black ink, 3px)
5. User taps "Use Signature" ‚Üí Saved to profile
6. User taps "Cancel" ‚Üí Returns without saving

When Signature Exists:
1. User sees signature preview with 'X' button
2. User taps 'X' ‚Üí Confirmation: "Delete signature?"
3. User confirms ‚Üí Signature deleted locally
4. signatureMarkedForDeletion = true, needsSignatureSync = true
5. User taps signature ‚Üí Opens new capture (fresh canvas)
```

##### Signature Processing
```
1. Canvas Setup:
   - 16:9 aspect ratio (640x360px)
   - If device width < 640px: Use device width
   - White canvas on dark grey background
   - Fixed colors (not theme-dependent)

2. Drawing Specs:
   - Black ink (#000000)
   - Fixed 3px stroke width
   - No pressure sensitivity
   - No guides or helpers

3. Save Process:
   - Auto-crop all whitespace
   - Convert to JPEG (95% quality)
   - No validation (any mark accepted)
   - Save to: SnagSnapper/{userId}/Profile/signature.jpg (fixed name)
   - Previous file automatically overwritten

4. Database Update:
   - signatureLocalPath = relative path
   - needsSignatureSync = true
   - signatureMarkedForDeletion = preserve if true, false otherwise
   - Previous signature file automatically overwritten
```

##### Sync Behavior
```
Same as profile image:
- Background sync when online
- Upload to: users/{userId}/signature.jpg
- Store path (not URL): "users/{userId}/signature.jpg"
- Delete from Firebase if signatureMarkedForDeletion && signatureLocalPath == null
- Set needsProfileSync = true for Firestore update
- Retry forever until successful
```

#### 4.3.6 Critical Offline Scenarios

##### Delete-Then-Add Scenario (Key Design Decision)
```
When user deletes then adds an image while offline:

1. User has synced image
2. Deletes image (offline):
   - imageLocalPath = null
   - imageMarkedForDeletion = true (PERSISTS!)
   - needsImageSync = true
   - imageFirebasePath = "users/{userId}/profile.jpg" (kept for reference)

3. Adds new image (still offline):
   - imageLocalPath = "SnagSnapper/{userId}/Profile/profile.jpg"
   - imageMarkedForDeletion = true (STILL TRUE - this is critical!)
   - needsImageSync = true
   - imageFirebasePath = "users/{userId}/profile.jpg" (unchanged)

4. When sync runs:
   - Skip deletion (optimization - new image will overwrite)
   - Upload new image from imageLocalPath (auto-overwrites in Firebase)
   - Set needsProfileSync = true
   - Update Firestore with path "users/{userId}/profile.jpg"
   - Clear all flags after successful sync

Key Point: imageMarkedForDeletion persists through the add operation
until sync completes. This ensures proper cleanup in Firebase.
```

#### 4.3.7 Manual Sync Flow
```
1. User taps sync button
2. Check connectivity
3. IF online:
   a. Show sync progress
   b. Upload profile changes
   c. Upload pending images
   d. Clear sync flags on success
   e. Update sync indicator
4. IF offline:
   a. Show "No connection" toast
   b. Keep changes local
```

### 4.4 UI Components

#### 4.4.1 Profile Screen
- **Header**: Company logo display
- **Form Fields**: Name, email, phone, job title, company, postcode
- **Image Upload**: Camera/gallery selection for logo
- **Signature Capture**: Full-screen drawing pad for digital signature
- **Date Format**: Toggle between UK/US formats
- **Sync Indicator**: Shows pending changes count

#### 4.4.2 Sync Indicator Design (Selected: Option C)
**Status Bar Implementation**
- Position: Below app bar
- Shows: "X changes pending sync" 
- Button: "SYNC NOW" when changes exist
- Colors:
  - Orange background when changes pending
  - Green background when fully synced
  - Red background when sync error
- Height: 40px
- Animation: Slide down when status changes
- Auto-hide: After 3 seconds when synced
- Persistent: When changes pending or error

### 4.5 Validation Rules

#### 4.5.1 Field Validations
- **Name**: Required, 2-50 characters
- **Email**: Required, valid email format
- **Phone**: Optional, valid phone format
- **Job Title**: Required, 2-50 characters
- **Company Name**: Required, 2-100 characters
- **Postcode**: Optional, alphanumeric

#### 4.5.2 Image Validations
- **Profile Image**: Max 5MB input, converted to JPEG
- **Signature**: Max 2MB input, converted to JPEG
- **Format**: All images converted to JPEG
- **Max Dimensions**: Fixed at 1024x1024 pixels (required)
- **Two-Tier Size Validation**:
  - **Optimal Target**: < 600KB (preferred)
  - **Maximum Limit**: < 1MB (acceptable)
  - **Compression Strategy**:
    1. Start with 90% JPEG quality (better first-pass success)
    2. If size > 600KB, reduce quality iteratively (by 10% steps)
    3. Stop at 30% quality minimum (don't go lower)
    4. Final validation:
       - If ‚â§ 600KB ‚Üí Save as "optimal"
       - If 600KB-1MB ‚Üí Save as "acceptable" with warning
       - If > 1MB ‚Üí Reject with error message
- **User Feedback**:
  - Optimal: "‚úÖ Image optimized successfully (size: XXXkB)"
  - Acceptable: "‚ö†Ô∏è Image compressed to XXXkB (larger than optimal)"
  - Rejected: "‚ùå Image too complex. Please choose a simpler image"

### 4.6 Error Handling 

#### 4.6.1 Sync Errors
- Network timeout: Retry with exponential backoff
- Firebase quota: Show warning, disable auto-sync
- Conflict: Local version wins
- Corrupted data: Fallback to Firebase

#### 4.6.2 Storage Errors
- Disk full: Show warning to user
- Corrupted image: Clear and re-download
- Missing file: Fallback to placeholder

#### 4.6.3 Crash & Error Reporting
- **Firebase Crashlytics Integration**:
  - Automatic crash reports with stack traces
  - Non-fatal error logging for handled exceptions
  - User identification (anonymous user ID only)
  - Custom keys for debugging context
  
- **Breadcrumb Trail**:
  - Log user actions before crash (last 20 events)
  - Track navigation flow: "Profile ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Image Selected"
  - Record sync events: "Sync Started ‚Üí Network Error ‚Üí Retry Queued"
  - Include device state: online/offline, battery level, storage space
  
- **Implementation Pattern**:
  ```dart
  // Before risky operations
  FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.log('Starting image upload');
  FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCustomKey('image_size', fileSize);
  
  // In catch blocks
  FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordError(
    error,
    stackTrace,
    reason: 'Image upload failed',
    fatal: false,
  );
  ```
  
- **Privacy Compliance**:
  - No PII in breadcrumbs (no names, emails, phones)
  - Use anonymous identifiers only
  - Clear logs on user logout
  - GDPR compliant data retention (30 days)

### 4.7 Performance Requirements
- Profile load: < 100ms from local DB
- Image display: < 200ms from local storage
- Sync operation: Non-blocking background
- UI response: Always immediate

### 4.8 Security Requirements
- **No sensitive data in logs**: Never log passwords, tokens, or user PII
  - Review all debug statements before commits
  - Use breadcrumbs instead of full data dumps
  - Zero runtime overhead, high security value
  
- **Platform encryption**: Automatic iOS/Android disk encryption
  - iOS: Automatic with device passcode (since iOS 8)
  - Android: File-based encryption (since Android 10)
  - No code required - OS handles transparently
  
- **Secure credential storage**: Use platform secure storage for sensitive data
  - Implementation: `flutter_secure_storage` package
  - Store: device_id, session tokens, sync credentials
  - Benefit: Protected from rooted device access
  - Marketing value: "Military-grade secure storage"

- **Firebase App Check**: Protect backend resources from abuse
  - Already implemented in the app
  - Validates requests are from legitimate app instances
  - Prevents API abuse, bot attacks, and billing fraud
  - Attestation providers:
    - iOS: DeviceCheck or App Attest
    - Android: Play Integrity API
    - Web: reCAPTCHA v3
  - Protects: Firestore, Storage, Functions, and Realtime Database
  - Marketing value: "Enterprise-grade API protection"
