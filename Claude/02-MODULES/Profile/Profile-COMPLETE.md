## 🎯 Recommendation

**Current State**: The Profile module is functionally complete and stable for offline use. The remaining 10% is primarily Firebase integration testing and optimization.

**Recommendation**: 
1. Complete Firebase testing (2 days)
2. Fix high-priority bugs (1 day)
3. Get your approval on current state
4. Move to Snag Creation module
5. Return for Phase 4 later if needed

**Decision Needed**: Complete 100% now or move forward at 90%?
